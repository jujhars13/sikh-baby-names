# Sikh Baby Names

Returns a CSV of all Gurbani(scripture) words beginning with unique instances of the letter you specify.  Used to find Sikh baby names.

**NB** The software simply returns the last instance of a word which doesn't work for synonyms eg
`grB` and `grB` which can mean womb and ego respectively depending on context.

Uses the [http://beta.igurbani.com/]() database to search in:
- Guru Granth Sahib Jee
- Bhai Gurdas' Vaaran
- Dasam Granth

## install

```bash
# the sqlite3 node-gyp build may give you some jip, so be prepared to Google

Found 1950 unique words beginning with r
Writing csv to /tmp/letter-r_2019-11-27T11:33:29.723Z.csv
